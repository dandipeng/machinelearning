Comments
==========
- Code and analysis are somewhat disorganized - conclusions are not centralized and some hardcoding
- Good try at group lasso, PCA, etc.
- Method selection was based on one test set, no cross-validation
- PR curves/ROC are incorrect (should be based on score not prediction)
- Great feature construction and novelty of pipeline
